                                September 22, 2018
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you might've noticed, I have, once again, changed up the page's color schemes, from the old blue &amp; gold to a simple greyscale scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have found out that, after long exposures to the page, the reader can become a little nauseous with the old colors &#40;speaking from experience&#41;, thus this simple scheme is used instead.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Besides, it's more pleasing on the eyes.

                            <h4>Changed navigation bar on mobile</h4>
                            <p class="date">
                                September 18, 2018

                            <p>
                                I have redesigned the collapsible navigation bar on mobile, with some minor changes to the desktop navigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On mobile browsers, the collapsible navigation bar is much more rounded &amp; more apparent to the user. The navigation bar is also no longer always on top of the page, and will scroll with the user as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, the navigation bar for desktop is moved from overhead to a sidebar, and is accessible at any moment for desktop viewers!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                EDIT 1: I have also changed up the navigation bar's, header's, and headings' fontstyles from Noto Serif to Open Sans - this allows for a cleaner, more modernized look while not being distracting from the main text's Noto Serif!

                            <p class="date">
                                September 14, 2018
                            </p>

                                As you might've noticed, I had updated the color scheme of this webpage a bit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the majority of the webpage retains its usual color scheme, I have also darkened the background and added some gold-yellow colors onto the navigation panel. This is to allow the colors to be more ergonomic to the eye, and the colors do look good together as well.

                                I am currently designing a progressive webapp &#40;PWA&#41; to input, track, and predict weight logs of a person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the draft, I have included a navbar &#40;for navigating to other pages in the PWA&#41;, a graph of date/time against current weight &#40;with max boundary being the largest weight rounded up to nearest integer, and the min boundary being the smallest weight rounded down to nearest integer&#41;, a section for scrollable table of date, time, &amp; weight, and a floating action button &#40;also known as FAB in Android applications&#41; which opens a page for user to input weight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is currently in the drafting stage, but it should come to fruition soon.

                                This page is where I will be posting my progress in personal projects and university-related works which I deem could be beneficial to mention here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have arranged the date format in a &quot;YYmmDD&quot; format - this is to allow possible semantic sorting of such posts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is currently no plans as of yet to implement such sorting mechanic, but anything is possible, so stay tuned!
