                                There is not much to talk about here - just a note that I changed up the SoundCloud playlists a bit: mainly the design of the main playlist &amp; the heights of the other playlists, but that's about it.

                                As you might've noticed, I have, once again, changed up the page's color schemes, from the old blue &amp; gold to a simple greyscale scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have found out that, after long exposures to the page, the reader can become a little nauseous with the old colors &#40;speaking from experience&#41;, thus this simple scheme is used instead.

                                I have redesigned the collapsible navigation bar on mobile, with some minor changes to the desktop navigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On mobile browsers, the collapsible navigation bar is much more rounded &amp; more apparent to the user. The navigation bar is also no longer always on top of the page, and will scroll with the user as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, the navigation bar for desktop is moved from overhead to a sidebar, and is accessible at any moment for desktop viewers!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                EDIT 1: I have also changed up the navigation bar's, header's, and headings' fontstyles from Noto Serif to Open Sans - this allows for a cleaner, more modernized look while not being distracting from the main text's Noto Serif!

This is to allow the colors to be more ergonomic to the eye, and the colors do look good together as well.

                                In the draft, I have included a navbar &#40;for navigating to other pages in the PWA&#41;, a graph of date/time against current weight &#40;with max boundary being the largest weight rounded up to nearest integer, and the min boundary being the smallest weight rounded down to nearest integer&#41;, a section for scrollable table of date, time, &amp; weight, and a floating action button &#40;also known as FAB in Android applications&#41; which opens a page for user to input weight.

                                This page is where I will be posting my progress in personal projects and university-related works which I deem could be beneficial to mention here.
                            </p>

                                I have arranged the date format in a &quot;YYmmDD&quot; format - this is to allow possible semantic sorting of such posts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is currently no plans as of yet to implement such sorting mechanic, but anything is possible, so stay tuned!
